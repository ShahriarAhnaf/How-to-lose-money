# How-to-lose-money
A quest to maximize strategy testing returns. The numbers used here are never encourage gambling, but to put strategy to test


Always test your strategies on the asset and time period that it can be applicable to!

Always compare with buy and hold return instead of ratios first, point is to beat the buy and hold not the ratios.

**Tips to optimize!**

period  = how fast your data is! for now always stick to ATLEAST 1 hour candles otherwise too many orders for humanly possible trading

faster MACD length = more orders = more losses to speed and trading inefficiency

higher MACD length is safer for overall trading without botting and getting algo speed

*RSI* THE NEW ADDTION!!

- some stocks heavily benefit from it! back test to figure out the proper weigthing and offset!


CURRENT GOAL!
ADD TAKE PROFIT AND STOP LOSS FEATURE TO PREVENT MASSIVE SPIKES AND DRAWDOWNS

DO NOT BACKTEST AND FIT STRATEGY TO EACH STOCK-----> OVERFITTING!!

NEW INDICATORS IS NEEDED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE UNPROFITABLE BUYS ARE BEING REDUCED ! THE INDICATOR RIGHT NOW CAN FIND THE PROFITABLE TIMES HOWEVER IT KEEPS GOING FOR UNPROFITABLE TRADES TOO MANY TIMES
